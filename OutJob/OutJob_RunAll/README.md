# How it works
Runs all output jobs by reading parameters from .OutJob file. It will iterate all workspace projects until it finds an OutJob file, if it doesn't find one it will prompt the user for an .OutJob file location. 

# Support
Supports any pdf generation or gerber, BOM, assembly, IPC, ODB, etc.
Everything but print jobs (printing direct to the printer)
